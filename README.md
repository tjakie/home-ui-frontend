# Home-UI

Home-ui is my implementation how I imagine homeautomation should be in software(KeepItSimpleStupid).
Every hardware device has it's own node process that's managed and logged via the main application.

## Current modules are implemented
- Tradfri
- Tplink HS100
- Harmony Hub
- Suncalc
   
## Modules comming soon
- Implementation of ps4-waker
- Custom hardware (you can insert a state/set url and that will make a device and poll for changes!)
- z-wave
- p1 reader

## Installation
I develop on a debian machine so I've created a simple to use install script!
curl https://github.com/tjakie/home-ui-frontend/install_debian.sh | sh
